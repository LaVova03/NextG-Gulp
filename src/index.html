                <li>
                  <span>The N95 mask</span> is a form of respiratory protective
                  wear worn over the nose and mouth to help minimise the chance
                  of inhaling airborne particles like viruses and other germs.
                  It is a disposable mask made from synthetic polymer fibres
                  produced in a highly specialised process called melt blowing.
                  During this process, the inner layer of the N95 mask is
                  created which forms the filtration layer capable of filtering
                  out at <span>least 95%</span> of airborne particles when worn
                  correctly. <br /><br />
                  During outbreaks of respiratory illnesses and during periods
                  of intense air pollution, wearing
                  <span>N95 masks</span> has been shown to help reduce the
                  inhalation of compromised air, filtering out nasty pathogens
                  which lead to illness or which can aggravate existing
                  respiratory problems. Maintaining clear and unhindered
                  respiration is vitally important for remaining fit and healthy
                  and people with pre-existing conditions or respiratory
                  fragility can particularly benefit from wearing face masks
                  while they are out in public and unable to control the
                  breathing environments that they find themselves in.

                <li>N95 Respirators In Industrial And Health Care Settings</li>
                <li>
                  Most <span>N95 respirators</span> are manufactured for use in
                  construction and other industrial type jobs that expose
                  workers to dust and small particles. They are regulated by the
                  National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory (NPPTL) in
                  the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health
                  (NIOSH), which is part of the Centers for Disease Control and
                  Prevention (CDC). <br /><br />
                  However, some N95 respirators are intended for use in a health
                  care setting. Specifically, single-use, disposable respiratory
                  protective devices used and worn by health care personnel
                  during procedures to protect both the patient and health care
                  personnel from the transfer of microorganisms, body fluids,
                  and particulate material. These surgical N95 respirators are
                  class II devices regulated by the FDA, under 21 CFR 878.4040,
                  and CDC NIOSH under 42 CFR Part 84.
